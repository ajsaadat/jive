This assignment was done based on the following assumptions:
 1)Once a deck of card was created, it can't be deleted. 
 2)An empty deck can not be deleted. 
 3)When a new deck is created, it is automatically shuffled. 
 4)When a deck is shuffled, its content at that time will be shuffled. For example, if
    the deck has 10 cards left within it, those cards will be shuffled. 
 5)Shuffling on an empty deck has no effect. 
 6)A deck can be created by issuing a post to application URL.
 7)A deck can be shuffled by issuing a put with deckID parameter to application URL.
 8)A card can be retrieved from a deck by issuing a get with deckID parameter to application URL.
 9) There are three implementations of DeckManager, first fully synchronized version, DeckManagerImpl
    second partial synchronized on a deck of card, ConcurrentDeckManager and finally non blocking one,     which is an experiment, NonBlockingDeckManager. 
10)Application is only hooked to one of mentioned implementation of DeckManager, DeckManagerImpl at the time of submittion.
